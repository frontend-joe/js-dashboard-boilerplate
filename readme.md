# js-dashboard-boilerplate

This HTML and CSS boilerplate project is intended for those enrolled on my JS Dashboard Masterclass course. If you've already booked your place, then please clone this repo to get familiar with the code!

> This course will change the way you write
> and structure your JS code. Joe makes use
> of loads of modern techniques to write a clean
> and highly readable codebase. I was lucky enough
> to review it early and learnt so much just from
> the first video. Will definitely be adding a
> live dashboard to my web portfolio.
